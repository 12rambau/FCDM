### Project
ReCaREDD - JRC of the European Commission

### Purpose  
- Mapping all kind of canopy disturbances (natural or human induced) within (semi-)evergreen forests
- Disturbances can be interpreted as forest degradation events (after threshold -e.g. 0.02- is applied to separate signal from noise)
- In order to separate natural from human disturbances we recommend manual screening of the data by an experienced human interpreter
- Close to real time monitoring of canopy cover changes possible

### Info     
- SR-TOA Combination (SR data with 'simpleCloudScore' band coming from TOA data)
- Basic methodology described in the paper published in the Remote Sensing journal:   http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/4/544
